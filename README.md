# OpenAI / ChatGPT / AI Search Integration

The Backdrop CMS OpenAI module makes it possible to interact with the
[OpenAI API](https://openai.com/) to implement features using
various API services.

The OpenAI module aims to provide a suite of modules and an API foundation
for OpenAI integration in Backdrop CMS for generating text content, images, content
analysis and more. OpenAI is the company behind artificial generational
intelligence products that powers applications like ChatGPT, GPT-3, GitHub
CoPilot, and more. Our goal is to find ways of augmenting and adding assistive
AI tech leveraging OpenAI API services in Backdrop CMS.

## Requirements
