# OpenAI / ChatGPT / AI Search Integration

The Backdrop CMS OpenAI module makes it possible to interact with the
[OpenAI API](https://openai.com/) to implement features using
various API services.

The OpenAI module aims to provide a suite of modules and an API foundation
for OpenAI integration in Backdrop CMS for generating text content, images, content
analysis and more. OpenAI is the company behind artificial generational
intelligence products that powers applications like ChatGPT, GPT-3, GitHub
CoPilot, and more. Our goal is to find ways of augmenting and adding assistive
AI tech leveraging OpenAI API services in Backdrop CMS.

## Requirements

You are required to provide an OpenAI key before you can use
any of the provided services.

## Installation

- Install this module using the official [Backdrop CMS instructions](https://backdropcms.org/user-guide/modules).

- Enable the core OpenAI module and one or more submodules that meet your needs.

## Included Submodules

### **openai_audio**  
Adds capability to interact with the OpenAI audio (speech-to-text) endpoints.

### **openai_chatgpt**  
Enables interaction with the Chat endpoint via the ChatGPT API.

### **openai_ckeditor**  
Provides a button for CKEditor 5 to send a prompt to OpenAI and receive generated text back.

### **openai_content**  
Adds assistive tools for different areas of the content editing process. This includes functionality to adjust the tone of the content, summarize body text, suggest taxonomy terms for nodes, and check content for [moderation violations](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/moderation/overview).

### **openai_dalle**  
Adds capability to interact with the OpenAI DALL·E (image generation) endpoint, supporting both the new DALL·E 3 model and DALL·E 2 model.

### **openai_devel**  
Adds GPT content generation capability to Devel Generate. This provides Devel a way of generating realistic content (not lorem ipsum) using GPT and ChatGPT models. Users can generate sample content from the Drupal UI or via Drush. This is useful for filling out your site with realistic content for client demonstrations, layout, theming, or QA.

### **openai_dblog**  
Demonstrates log analysis using OpenAI to find potential solutions or explanations for error logs. Responses from OpenAI are saved and persist for common error messages, allowing you to review them.

### **openai_prompt**  
Adds an area in the admin interface to explore OpenAI text generation capabilities and ask it (prompt) for whatever you'd like.

### **openai_embeddings**  
Analyzes nodes and generates vectors and text embeddings of your nodes, taxonomy, media, and paragraph entities from OpenAI. Responses from OpenAI are saved and could augment search, ranking, automatically suggest taxonomy terms for content, and [improve search relevancy without expensive search backends. Content personalization and recommendation](https://www.pinecone.io/) may also be possible with this approach.

### **openai_tts**  
Adds capability to interact with the OpenAI TTS (text-to-speech) endpoints.
